# chart-color-generator

This repository shows you how to automatically generate chart colors with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [D3 Scale Chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic). We specifically use D3 Scale Chromatic's **interpolate** color functions.

## Tutorial

We've written a detailed tutorial that walks you through the color generating functions and chart creation. Read it on the :star2: CodeNebula blog: [Automatically Generate Chart Colors with Chart.js & D3's Color Scales](https://codenebula.io/javascript/frontend/dataviz/2019/04/18/automatically-generate-chart-colors-with-chart-js-d3s-color-scales/).

## Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in your code editor
2. Change the "Example Data" parameters listed on lines 76 - 101 (change line 95 if you'd like to test another D3 interpolate color scale)
3. Navigate to your browser and open `index.html` to see the generated chart
